<p><strong>Subject:</strong> 🏈 HFL Week 1 Wrap-Up – The Season Opens with Drama</p><p><strong>Body:</strong></p><p>Managers of the Happy Fun League,</p><p>Week 1 is in the books, and the league has already delivered close calls, runaway wins, and some world-class benchwarming. Let’s break it down.</p><hr/><p><strong>Highlights at a glance</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Top Dog:</strong> The Arizona Wombats put up the week’s biggest number, a tidy <strong>96.0</strong>.</li><li><strong>Player of the Week:</strong> Josh Allen lit it up with <strong>38.0</strong> points, reminding us why Buffalo wings come with extra heat.</li><li><strong>Nail-Biter Special:</strong> Team Engelwoman squeaked by Glen’s Trout <strong>73–72</strong>, a finish so close it could only have been decided by the coin toss you didn’t see.</li><li><strong>Statement Win:</strong> Arizona Smol Puppers rolled over SB Holy Warriors by <strong>23.0</strong>. Nothing holy about that beatdown.</li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Scoreboard (with Totally Legit Vegas Lines™)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Arizona Cardinals 81.0</strong> def. Philly Fly Eagles Fly 71.0<br /><em>(hats off to Justin)</em> | line: Cardinals -4.0 [calculated using the average number of crying fits per household on Sunday]</li><li><strong>Slater Chatty Cathies 93.0</strong> def. Pray for Mojo 71.0<br /><em>(The Cathies will be insufferable all week)</em> | line: Cathies -7.5 [set by incorrectly extrapolating from Marliese’s coffee consumption]</li><li><strong>Arizona Wombats 96.0</strong> def. Big dog Fin 80.0<br /><em>(somebody buy me a trophy already, no need to wait for the end of the season)</em> | line: Wombats -6.0 [sourced from the Team Engelwoman Summer League of Questionable Math]</li><li><strong>Arizona Smol Puppers 76.0</strong> def. SB Holy Warriors 53.0<br /><em>(congrats Alana, clearly bribed the refs)</em> | line: Puppers -5.0 [derived from backyard cornhole scoring patterns and proximity to the vernal equinox]</li><li><strong>Team Engelwoman 73.0</strong> def. Tempe Trout 72.0<br /><em>(Andrea’s check cleared the refs’ accounts just in time)</em> | line: Engelwoman -1.5 [produced by a random number generator stuck on “nail-biter”]</li><li><strong>Big Dog Will 83.0</strong> def. T-Dog’s Bruisers 80.0<br /><em>(the crowd goes wild for William)</em> | line: Big Dog -2.0 [determined by the average volume of the bark of neighborhood dogs]</li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Bench Oopsies</strong></p><p>Ah yes, the part of the email that keeps us humble. Week 1 delivered:</p><ul><li>The Cardinals left <strong>Geno Smith (17 pts)</strong> on the bench.</li><li>The Chatty Cathies ignored <strong>Baker Mayfield (21 pts)</strong> like it was still 2019.</li><li>Smol Puppers benched <strong>Justin Fields (28 pts!)</strong>—yep, that’s almost half their starter output.</li><li>Trout sat <strong>Justin Herbert (27 pts)</strong>, which would have flipped their one-point loss. Painful.</li><li>Big Dog Will parked <strong>Caleb Williams (23 pts)</strong>.</li><li>And several others apparently thought their benches were for fireworks displays.</li></ul><p>Points on the bench don’t win championships—but they sure do fuel this email.</p><hr/><p><strong>Closing Words</strong></p><p>As your <strong>Commissioner-for-life</strong>, I salute the bold starts, the tragic sits, and the creative excuses already flowing in your minds. Remember: every lineup choice is a chance to make history—or embarrass yourself terribly.</p><p>Week 1 set the bar low. Let’s see who fails to clear it next Sunday.</p><p>With barely hidden contempt,</p><p><strong>Jeremiah, </strong>Commissioner-for-life</p>
