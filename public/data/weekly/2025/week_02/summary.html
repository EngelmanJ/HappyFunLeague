<p><strong>Subject:</strong> 🏈 HFL Week 2 Wrap-Up – Blowouts, Benches, and Bruises</p><p><strong>Body:</strong></p><p>Managers of the Happy Fun League,</p><p>Week 2 is done, and what a week it was: massive blowouts, close calls, and at least one team apparently mistook their bench for a starting lineup audition. However, before we talk about Week 2, we need to talk about Marliese. You often hear about a player being the G.O.A.T. Due to her decisive win over Phil in Week 1, and her extra humble behavior in it’s wake, she is to be known as the G.L.O.A.T. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure out what the ‘L’ stands for.</p><p><strong>Shameless pitch:</strong> Check out the <strong>Happy Fun League Records of Glory &amp; Shame</strong> and <strong>Weekly Summaries of Glory &amp; Shame</strong> at https://engelmanj.github.io/HappyFunLeague/</p><p>And now on to Week 2…</p><hr/><p><strong>Highlights at a glance</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Big Dog on Campus:</strong> Big dog Fin flexed the biggest score of the week with a monster <strong>122</strong>.</li><li><strong>Player of the Week:</strong> Jared Goff came out slinging, racking up <strong>33</strong> points.</li><li><strong>Nail-biter:</strong> Arizona Wombats squeaked past the Arizona Smol Puppers <strong>101–96</strong>, a win so tight it’ll haunt the Puppers in their sleep.</li><li><strong>Statement Win:</strong> Big dog Fin absolutely buried SB Holy Warriors by <strong>62</strong>.
