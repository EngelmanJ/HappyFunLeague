<p><strong>Subject:</strong> 🏈 HFL Week 5 Wrap-Up — Mojo Rising, Benches Crying</p><p>Owners of the Happy Fun League,</p><p>Week 5 arrived like a mid-season reboot: surprise plot twists, a couple of blowouts that needed content warnings, and at least one roster that looked like it was managed by a committee of raccoons with a group chat. The jokes write themselves, but I will, of course, write them anyway because service journalism.</p><hr/><p><strong>Highlights at a glance</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Highest Team Score:</strong> <strong>Pray for Mojo</strong> clocked <strong>117</strong>, which is either destiny or Phil found the “start best players” button.</li><li><strong>Player of the Week:</strong> <strong>Jonathan Taylor</strong> put up a clean <strong>28 </strong>— classic “I heard you drafted me for exactly this” energy.</li><li><strong>Nail-Biter:</strong> <strong>SB Holy Warriors</strong> edged <strong>Big Dog Will</strong> by <strong>8</strong> (80–72). Not a heart attack, but definitely chest tightness.</li><li><strong>Statement Win:</strong> <strong>Pray for Mojo</strong> ran past <strong>Arizona Smol Puppers</strong> by <strong>44</strong> (117–73). That’s not just a W—that’s a family film where Mojo discovers friendship, teamwork, and that points count double when Phil scores them.</li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Scoreboard (with Totally Legit Vegas Lines™)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Arizona Smol Puppers 73 @ Pray for Mojo 117 → Pray for Mojo by 44</strong><br />Line: <strong>Mojo -19.2</strong>. The “Mojo Dojo Casa House” had its best attendance since last summer; Alana will be sending a strongly worded letter to the scriptwriters.</li><li><strong>Big Dog Will 72 @ SB Holy Warriors 80 → SB Holy Warriors by 8</strong><br />Line: <strong>SB Holy Warriors -4.8</strong>. A low-scoring slugfest where tight ends got more targets than a Marvel post-credit scene rumor.</li><li><strong>Arizona Cardinals 74 @ Arizona Wombats 96 → Arizona Wombats by 22</strong><br />Line: <strong>Wombats -14.8</strong>. Marsupial mauling. Jeremiah’s victory sash remains, tragically, in regular rotation.</li><li><strong>Team Engelwoman 90 @ Philly Fly Eagles Fly 100 → Philly Fly Eagles Fly by 10</strong><br />Line: <strong>Eagles -16.5</strong>. Philly fans booed during the national anthem, a touchdown, and a heartwarming commercial about puppies. Consistency matters.</li><li><strong>T-Dog’s Bruisers 103 @ Slater Chatty Cathies 91 → T-Dog’s Bruisers by 12</strong><br />Line: <strong>Bruisers -14.8</strong>. Marliese’s G.L.O.A.T. parade float remains street-legal, just moving a little slower this week.</li><li><strong>Big dog Fin 84 @ Tempe Trout 66 → Big dog Fin by 18</strong><br />Line: <strong>Big dog Fin -2.8</strong>. A fish fry so thorough it came with hushpuppies. Glen will be “reviewing tape,” which is code for muttering at clouds.</li></ul><hr/><p><strong>Bench Oopsies</strong></p><p>The bench is where dreams go to cry softly into their helmets:</p><ul><li><strong>Pray for Mojo</strong> parked <strong>Matthew Stafford (25)</strong> while the starter managed <strong>20</strong>. That’s two national-TV cutaways worth of regret. &lt;Jeremiah: I don’t know what this means. Maybe someone smarter can make sense of it for me.&gt; </li><li><strong>SB Holy Warriors</strong> stashed <strong>Javonte Williams (25)</strong> and <strong>Rachaad White (19)</strong> while a starter RB put up <strong>6</strong>. A two-for-one special in the “unwatched pot never boils” department.</li><li><strong>Big Dog Will</strong> benched <strong>Rashid Shaheed (17)</strong> while a starter WR found <strong>3</strong> lonely points.</li><li><strong>Arizona Cardinals</strong> ignored <strong>Jacory Croskey-Merritt (24)</strong> while a starter RB posted <strong>4</strong>. That’s an entire sitcom episode of points.</li><li><strong>Slater Chatty Cathies</strong> let <strong>Baker Mayfield (26)</strong> marinate while a QB starter put up <strong>19</strong>. Somewhere a Progressive ad nods solemnly.</li><li><strong>T-Dog’s Bruisers</strong> held <strong>Bo Nix (17)</strong> while the starter found <strong>11</strong>. Close, but every little “what if” becomes a loud “why didn’t I?” by Tuesday morning.</li><li><strong>Tempe Trout</strong> benched <strong>Kareem Hunt (16)</strong> while a starter RB had <strong>2</strong>. That’s not a gap; that’s a canyon with a gift shop.</li><li><strong>Big dog Fin</strong> shelved <strong>C.J. Stroud (28)</strong> with a starter at <strong>26</strong>—technically fine, emotionally devastating.</li></ul><p>Moral: Chekhov’s Bench—if a 25-pointer appears in Act I, it will be started by someone else in Act II. (Yes, I explained the joke. That’s how jokes become folklore.) </p><hr/><p><strong>Next Week: Matchups (preposterous lines included)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Big Dog Will @ Arizona Cardinals</strong> | <strong>Big Dog Will -10.9</strong><br />Vegas believes in bounce-backs and dogs that learn new tricks.</li><li><strong>Arizona Smol Puppers @ Slater Chatty Cathies</strong> | <strong>Smol Puppers -9.1</strong><br />Caffeine vs. canines: one chews slippers, the other chews through productivity.</li><li><strong>Team Engelwoman @ Big dog Fin</strong> | <strong>Big dog Fin -7.6</strong><br />Andrea’s “intuition spreadsheet” meets Finley’s revenge tour; Excel vs. dog emojis.</li><li><strong>Tempe Trout @ Pray for Mojo</strong> | <strong>Trout -17.5</strong><br />On paper this is Glen’s week; on vibes it’s Phil’s. Please consult your astrologer.</li><li><strong>Arizona Wombats @ Philly Fly Eagles Fly</strong> | <strong>Eagles -11.8</strong><br />A road test for the marsupials. If you hear booing, that’s just ambient Philadelphia.</li><li><strong>SB Holy Warriors @ T-Dog’s Bruisers</strong> | <strong>SB Holy Warriors -7.9</strong><br />Theology vs. uppercuts. Over/under on “amen” texts: 3.5.</li></ul><hr/><p>As your <strong>Commissioner-for-life</strong>, I celebrate the bold starts, clown the tragic sits, and encourage the kind of tasteful trash-talk that keeps the group chat spicy and HR nervous. Keep the receipts, keep the memes, and please set your Thursday players on Wednesday like civilized people.</p><p>With mock seriousness and real affection,<br /><strong>Jeremiah</strong><br />Commissioner-for-life</p>
